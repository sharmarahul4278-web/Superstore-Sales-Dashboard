### **3. Tech Stack**

The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:
• 📊 **Power BI Desktop** – Primary tool for data visualization and report creation.
• 📂 **Power Query** – Used for data cleaning, transformation, and preparation.
• 🧠 **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** – Used to create calculated measures such as total sales, profit, and growth.
• 🗄️ **Data Modeling** – Relationships created between tables like Orders, Customers, and Regions to enable dynamic filtering.
• 📁 **File Format** – `.pbix` for development and `.png` for dashboard screenshots.

### **4. Data Source**

**Source:** Superstore Sales Dataset (Excel/CSV).

The dataset contains historical sales records including:

* Order date
* State and region
* Product category and sub-category
* Sales and profit
* Customer information

This structured data was cleaned and transformed in Power Query before being visualized in Power BI.

### **5. Features / Highlights**

#### **Business Problem**

Retail businesses often struggle to understand:

* Which states generate the most revenue?
* Which products perform best?
* How sales trends change over time?
* What sales might look like in the next 15 days?

Without an interactive dashboard, these insights are buried in raw data and difficult to interpret quickly.

#### **Goal of the Dashboard**

The goal of this dashboard is to:

* Provide a clear visual overview of superstore sales performance.
* Identify top-performing states and products.
* Track sales trends over time.
* Use forecasting to predict sales for the next 15 days.
* Support data-driven business decisions.
